### Project Description
A satirical ‚Äúcalendar‚Äù app where managing your schedule turns into a cosmic distraction.
Instead of boosting productivity, it traps you in a goofy solar system simulator with orbit physics, mischievous buttons, and absurd reminder events that waste more time than they save.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Traditional calendar apps are designed to maximize productivity, but sometimes people just want to procrastinate in a fun, absurd way. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúscheduling tool‚Äù that actively sabotages efficiency while keeping the user entertained.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
OrbitCal‚Ñ¢ reimagines the calendar as a cosmic playground ‚Äî complete with orbital physics, evasive buttons, and ridiculous reminder events ‚Äî turning time management into a humorous, intentionally unproductive experience.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- JavaScript , CSS and html

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
No installation required ‚Äî just download or clone the project files.
git clone https://github.com/Emilin24/UselessProjects.git
cd UselessProjects

# Run
Open afterlogin.html in any modern web browser:
On macOS/Linux:
open afterlogin.html  
On Windows:
start afterlogin.html
Or simply double-click the file in your file explorer.

### Project Documentation
For Software:
Overview: OrbitCal‚Ñ¢ is a parody calendar app where orbital mechanics, unstable planets, and mischievous buttons make scheduling hilariously unproductive.

Features:
Drag Earth or use WASD keys to control its orbit
Dynamic date display based on orbit angle
Orbit stability meter with extinction events
Reminders panel with solar flare ‚Äúfailures‚Äù
Evasive ‚ÄúSet Reminder‚Äù button for extra frustration

Tech Stack:
HTML5
CSS3
Vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)

How to Use:
Open the page in a browser
Try to set a reminder (good luck catching the button)
Maintain orbit stability or cause an extinction event

# Diagrams

*OrbitCal‚Ñ¢ Workflow Architecture


-User Interaction
The user drags the Earth, presses movement keys, or clicks the ‚ÄúSet Reminder‚Äù button.

-Event Listener (JavaScript)
Listens for specific user actions (e.g., mouse drag, keyboard press, button click).

-Script Logic (Orbit / Reminders)
For orbit: Calculates new positions and updates the simulated date.
For reminders: Processes the entered reminder and triggers the confirmation message.

-Update DOM
JavaScript updates HTML elements to reflect changes (Earth‚Äôs position, date, reminder list).
Display Changes (Orbit & Reminders)
The browser visually shows the updated orbit and the saved reminders section.*

### Project Demo
# Video
https://github.com/Emilin24/UselessProjects/blob/main/orbitcaldemo.mp4

The video opens on the OrbitCal‚Ñ¢ login page, where instead of a normal authentication, the user is greeted with the question: ‚ÄúPinky promise this is your real account?‚Äù
To proceed, they must drag a cartoon pinky finger image across the screen until it touches another pinky finger image ‚Äî sealing the ‚Äúpromise.‚Äù

Once the promise is complete, the scene transitions to the main OrbitCal‚Ñ¢ dashboard, a playful solar system simulation. Earth orbits the Sun, and the date updates in real time based on its position. The user demonstrates how to drag the planet and watch the orbit stability meter respond.

Next, the video showcases the Set Reminder feature: typing a reminder, struggling to click the evasive ‚ÄúSet Reminder‚Äù button, and finally succeeding. A confirmation pops up, and the reminder appears in the Saved Reminders section with its own checkbox for completion.

The video ends with the saved reminders list on screen, highlighting OrbitCal‚Äôs unique blend of cosmic distraction and deliberately ineffective time management.

## Team Contributions
- Emilin Sana K S:  Implemented the orbital physics simulation and dynamic date system based on Earth‚Äôs position in orbit.
- Gabriela Brigita Fernandez: Developed the saved reminders feature, including the UI list and checkbox functionality.
